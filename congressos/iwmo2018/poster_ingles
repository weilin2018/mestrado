Introduction

in a global scale, water reservoirs are used to dump material from power plants and industries, where the biggest impact occur in areas with low circulation and water exchange with open ocean. In the context of nuclear power plants, 87% are installed closest to water bodies, using this waters in the cooling system. In Brazil, there is two nuclear power plants in operation located in the Almirante Alvaro Alberto Central Nuclear (AAACN), that capture waters and release them in the Ilha Grande Bay (Figure 1), region with great touristic and social ambiental importance.

Hence understand the circulation pattern in this region and avaliate the fate of possible radioactive contaminants, is essential to support the stakeholders, in the case of a nuclear leakage, such as occurred in Fukushima in 2011.

So, the goals of this work is to evaluate, in a hypothetical scenario of nuclear leakage, the dispersion from these nuclear materials and where they're will affect with bigger impact.
To do that, the wind and tidal driven circulation was analysed in the region, allowing, then, understand the radioactive material dispersion.
