=== introduction
About of 96% nuclear power plants, in the world, are installed closest to water bodies,
using this water in the cooling system. Based on that e remembering the terrible Fukushima's 
accident, in 2011, the motivation of this study was to better understand how will be the 
dispersion of the nuclear material released into the ocean in a semi-enclosed basin, like an
estuary, in hypothetical scenario of natural disaster (Tsunami,earthquake), who will lead
to a nuclear accident.

=== study area
The study area that we select to do this work is Angra dos Reis, located in Southeastern Brazil,
where there is two nuclear reactors in operation and a third under construction. We use
the Estuarine and Coastal Ocean Model (ECOM), forcing the hydrodynamic circulation with
tide, wind and river discharge. 

=== methods
We run three scenarios to evaluate the influence of which variable in surface circulation,
where the Experiment I we use northeassterly winds, in experiment II southwesterly winds and
the experiment III, only with tides forcing the boundaries.

Also, more 3 experiments are conducted, considering all forcings acting together
over circulation and with a instantaneous release of nuclear material. In those
experiments, we activate the Tracer Module, to visualize the dispersion of the material.

=== results

We separate the results in two sections. 
First, we observed the isolated influence of tide and wind in the circulation, using the
experiment I, II and III, by analyzing the mean surface current during each experiment.
In Figure 3, we can see the mean current generated by wind (northeasterly and southwesterly) and
by tides. We noted that velocities are higher when tides is considered, reaching intensities
closest to 0.6 m/s, while in the experiment with wind, the highest velocity observed was .25 m/s.

When we turn on the tracer module in, Experiments IV and V, we can visualize the
dispersion of the radioactive material. In those experiments, considering
river discharge, tide and wind (northeasterly in IV and southwesterly in V), we
assume that the direction of dispersion will be controlled by the wind's direction.
So, the tide will be the main mechanism acting on mixing this material, mainly
when the dispersion reach the eastern side of the domain, with highest tide-driven
circulation (Fig 4.d).

In second section, we use wind varying in space and time, in closest to real
conditions. We can observe (Fig 5) the propagation of the radioactive material
to the eastern region of the domain, where the velocities are higher and,
by consequence, the mixing of the pollutant will be higher.
However, we can see locally (zoomed area in Fig 5), that the material
persist in a semi-enclosed area (Ribeira Bay). This persistence is 
corroborated by [3], where the higher concentrations of Cs and Pb-137
are detected in surface sediment, in the same region where we point as
the most impacted area.

=== Conclusions
just look to the poster, Danilo.



=== Possible asks:

. Why tritium ?
half life of 12.42 years, so we can considerate tritium as a conservative
material, using it as a tracer of radioactive material.

. This model was validate?
We do not publish this work yet precisely because the absence of validation.
I'm looking for insitu data to validate. But looking in the literature,
the currents modelled here are compared to insitu data collected by Signorini,
in his articles of 1980.

. hot start?
