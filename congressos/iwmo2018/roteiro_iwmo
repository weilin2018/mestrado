About of 96% nuclear power plants, in the world, are installed closest to water bodies,
using this water in the cooling system. Based on that e remembering the terrible Fukushima's 
accident, in 2011, the motivation of this study was to better understand how will be the 
dispersion of the nuclear material released into the ocean in a semi-enclosed basin, like an
estuary, in hypothetical scenario of natural disaster (Tsunami,earthquake), who will lead
to a nuclear accident.


The stuty area selected to do this work is Angra dos Reis, located in Southeastern Brazil,
where there is two nuclear reactors in operation and a third under construction. We use
the Estuary and Coastal Ocean Model (ECOM), forcing the hydrodynamic circulation with
tide, wind and river discharge. 

We run three scenarios to evaluate the influence of which variable in surface circulation,
where the Experiment I we use northeassterly winds, in experiment II southwesterly winds and
the experiment III, only with tides forcing the boundaries.

Also, more 3 experiments are conducted, considering all forcings acting together
over circulation and with a instantaneous release of nuclear material. In those
experiments, we activate the Tracer Module, to visualize the dispersion of the material.

As results, we separate in two sections. First, we discuss how the wind and tide influence
the surface circulation and, as we can see in this figure, we identify that
during flood spring tide
