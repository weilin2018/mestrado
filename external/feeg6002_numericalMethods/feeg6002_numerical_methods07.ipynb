  "# Learning Outcomes\n",
  "\n",
  "-   List the three classical PDE categories and give one example of PDE for each category.\n",
  "-   Explain in your own words one key caracteristics of the solutions in each category.\n",
  "-   List two ways of speeding up the solution of linear system of equations.\n",
  "-   List the two main alternatives to the Finite Difference Method and discuss their strength and weaknesses.\n",
  "\n",
  "# Elliptical equations\n",
  "\n",
  "Solutions to the Laplace equation depend entirely on the boundary conditions. This is a bit like having a drum. If you change the boundaries of the drum, the automatically adopts a different shape. Likewise, changing the temperature of the boundaries instantaneously changes the Laplace equation solution, i.e. the steady state solution temperature throughout the domain. Equations exhibiting this type of behaviour are called *elliptical* equations. Two other common examples:\n",
  "1.  The *Poisson* equation,\n",
  "\n",
  "\\begin{equation}\n",
  "\\nabla^2 T = -\\frac{q}{k},\n",
  "\\end{equation}\n",
  "\n",
  "where $q$ is the heat flux and $k$ the thermal conductivity. The Poisson equation is also common in electomagnetism and fluid mechanics. It gives the Electric field for a particular distribution of charges, or the velocity potential given a particular distribution of fluid sinks or sources.\n",
  "\n",
  "1.  The *Helmholtz* equation:\n",
  "\n",
  "\\begin{equation}\n",
  "\\nabla^2 P' + k^2 P' = 0,\n",
  "\\end{equation}\n",
  "\n",
  "where $P'$ denotes pressure fluctuations in the frequency domain, and $k$ the wavenumber. The Helmholtz equation governs the propagation of sound or light at a particular frequency through a uniform medium.\n",
  "\n",
  "# Parabolic equations\n",
  "\n",
  "The prototype of parabolic equation is the heat equation\n",
  "\n",
  "\\begin{equation}\n",
  "\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\nabla^2 T,\n",
  "\\end{equation}\n",
  "\n",
  "where $\\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity. Parabolic equations are more complex than elliptical equations. Information propagates at constant speed from a particular hot spot, by diffusing slowly through the domain. The diffusion speed is controlled by $\\alpha$. Diffusion phenomena occur in fluid mechanics (e.g. diffusion of a pollutant in the ocean or in air) through viscosity. They are related to mixing.\n",
  "\n",
  "This time knowing the information at the boundary isn't enough to solve the equation. As we discussed in the first lecture on PDEs, provided we can discretize the right hand side in the above equation and therefore write it as a function $F(t, T)$, we can treat the resulting equation as an ODE and integrate it using for example Runge-Kutta methods. This is called the *method of lines*. For each time step, we would have to apply our Laplace operator, for example by multiplying $A$ with $U$ using the notations from the previous lecture. If we use an explicit Runge-Kutta method, such as RK4, there is no need to solve a linear system of equations.\n",
  "\n",
  "# Hyperbolic equations\n",
  "\n",
  "The prototype of hyperbolic equations is the wave equation:\n",
  "\n",
  "\\begin{equation}\n",
  "\\nabla^2 P' + \\frac{1}{c_0^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2}P' = 0,\n",
  "\\end{equation}\n",
  "\n",
  "where $c_0$ denotes the speed of sound. This equation describes how sound pressure fluctuations propagate in the time domain through a quiescent medium. Hyperbolic equations are hence related to wave phenomena.\n",
  "\n",
  "More generally, hyperbolic equations describe how a particular quantity is transported through a domain. Thus, a typical hyperbolic equation is the conservation equation:\n",
  "\n",
  "\\begin{equation}\n",
  "\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\mathbf u) = 0,\n",
  "\\end{equation}\n",
  "\n",
  "where, for example, $\\rho$ denotes density and $\\mathbf u$ velocity. This equation describes how mass is conserved in a fluid. Thus, if density increases at a particular location (for example because of an increase in pressure), we can track how this high density region will be *transported* through the flow as it is *convected* by flow velocity field.\n",
  "\n",
  "It is common to use non-central schemes, such as the [upwind scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upwind_scheme) in order to discretize spatial equations in this case. The idea behind the upwind scheme is to improve the stability of the scheme by going against the flow direction in the calculation of the partial derivatives in space.\n",
  "\n",
  "Note that if the flow (or convection) speed is higher than the speed of sound, which is the maximum speed at which information propagates through the flow, then the pressure field can not balance itself quickly enough and abrupt discontinuities appear in the flow. These are called shocks and are challenging to solve numerically and you need specialized methods such as Riemann solvers.\n",
  "\n",
  "# Advanced Partial Differential Equations\n",
  "\n",
  "In general, partial differential equations can not simply be characterized as elliptic, parabolic or hyperbolic, but tend to exhibit characteristics belonging to two or three of these categories. For example, the Navier-Stokes equations exhibit both hyperbolic and parabolic characters, via the conservation of mass and momentum on the one hand, and diffusion effects due to viscosity on the other hand. It is however useful to recognise some of these characteristics in the equation you are looking at, because this has implications on how best to solve this problem.\n",
  "\n",
  "# Order of methods for solving linear systems of equations equations\n",
  "\n",
  "Elliptic equations and implicit schemes for parabolic and hyperbolic equations require the solution of linear system of equations $A X = B$.  There are several ways of speeding up the solution. The first one is to use a more efficient algorithm. The order of a solver can dramatically change the time to a solution &#x2013; indeed as much or much more than just buying a bigger computer (or waiting for Moore's Law).\n",
  "A comparison of the algorithmic complexity of a variety of linear solvers is given in table 1.\n",
