  "# Introduction\n",
  "\n",
  "Along with the Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) we have considered previously, partial differential equations (PDEs) are another way in which we model problems in science and engineering. Their solution occupies a large amount of the time consumed on large scale high performance computers for tasks such as computational fluid dynamics, computational mechanics and computational electromagnetics which are used for modelling systems as diverse in size scale and complexity as climate and environmental modelling, the Universe, cars, planes, trains, ships and optical devices.\n",
  "\n",
  "Specialist courses exist which will study an individual application domain and its equations in huge detail and often highly tuned and specialised computational methods (and indeed even whole computer architectures and subsystems) have been developed for a particular system. Our purpose in this section is to introduce some of the key concepts and methods that underpin this universe of modelling possibilities.\n",
  "\n",
  "## Difference between ODEs and PDEs\n",
  "\n",
  "-   ODEs are differential equations containing **a single independent variable** so all the derivatives are ordinary dervatives. For example, given a scalar function $x \\mapsto f(x)$, the first and second derivatives are $f'$ or $f''$.\n",
  "-   PDEs are differential equations containing **two or more independent variables**, so the derivatives are partial derivatives. For example, given a function of two variables $(x,y) \\mapsto f(x,y)$, the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ are $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}$.\n",
  "\n",
  "## PDE example I: Laplace equation\n",
  "\n",
  "The Laplace equation is a second orderd PDE appearing for example in Fluid Mechanics (potential flows) and Electromagnetics (electromagnetic field in a charge free region):\n",
  "\n",
  "\\begin{align}\n",
  "&\\text{General:} \\qquad &\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0, \\\\\n",
  "&\\text{2D:} \\qquad &\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2}  + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2} = 0,\n",
  "\\end{align}\n",
  "\n",
  "where $\\phi$ represents, for example, the velocity potential.\n",
  "\n",
  "## PDE example II: Heat equation\n",

  "The heat equation is a second order PDE describing how temperature $T$ diffuses through a medium of thermal diffusivity $\\alpha$:\n",
  "\n",
  "\\begin{align}\n",
  "&\\text{General:} \\qquad &\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\nabla^2 T  \\\\\n",

  "\\end{align}\n",
  "\n",
  "## PDE example III: Wave equation\n",
  "\n",
  "The wave equation describes how the sound pressure $p$ propagates at speed $c_0$ through a medium (at rest), and plays a role in acoustics, fluid mechanics, but also cosmology and quantum mechanics:\n",
  "\n",
  "\\begin{align}\n",
  "&\\text{General:} \\qquad &\\frac{1}{c_0^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial t^2} +  \\nabla^2 p = 0  \\\\\n",

  "## Solution strategy for the Heat equation\n",
  "\n",
  "Let's consider the heat equation from example II in 1D:\n",
  "\n",

  "\\end{align}\n",
  "\n",
  "Given the solution at a time step $t_0$ the challenge is to estimate the solution at a later time $t_0 + h$. This is almost the same problem we had for ODEs, where we learned how to solve equations of the form\n",
  "\n",
  "\\begin{align}\n",
  "g'(t) = F(t, g(t)),\n",
  "\\end{align}\n",
  "\n",
  "using Euler's method or Runge-Kutta methods. Thus, if we could rewrite the right hand side of the heat equation as a function of time and $f$ (rather than $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}$) we'd be able to apply all the techniques we have learned in our study of ODEs to advance our solution in time.\n",
  "\n",
  "We therefore seek to approximate the second order partial derivative as\n",
  "\n",
  "\\begin{align}\n",
  "\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} \\approx F(f, x, t),\n",

  "\\end{align}\n",

  "which is an ODE we know how to solve.\n",
  "\n",
  "The key challenge is therefore to find good approximations for the spatial derivative with respect to $x$, in terms of only $f(x, t)$, $x$ and $t$. The *finite difference method* is a simple but powerful method for doing exactly this. The finite difference method will be introduced in the next section. It will then be used to solve the Laplace equation, which corresponds to the steady state solution of the Heat Equation. Solving the Heat Equation itself will be left as an exercise to the reader.\n",

  "## First central difference for first $f'(x)$\n",
  "\n",
  "Our aim with these methods is to replace the differential operator with an approximation which averages over nearby points and by using a mesh of such points we derive a set of simultaneous equations to solve. The trick is to apply Taylor's expansions at points near $f(x)$, such as $f(x-h)$ and $f(x+h)$, and to combine these expansions to obtain an approximation for the desired derivative.\n",

The *nodes* and *coefficients* define a unique finite difference *stencil* . The length of the stencil is therefore $2m + 1$. Typically, the length of the stencil must be longer than $n$, and higher orders of accuracy can be obtained by using longer stencils.\n",

  "Given a set of nodes $-m\\leq i \\leq m$, the stencil coefficients can be derived by applying Taylor's approximation to $f(x + i h)$ to the desired order of accuracy, for each value of $i$.
