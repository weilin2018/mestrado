  "\n",
  "Differential equations occur frequently in the solution of science and engineering problems to model devices, systems, and the world in which we live. You may already be familiar with a range of analytic techniques which can tackle a wide range of the most commonly occurring differential equations. In this section we show how computers can be also used to solve these equations and extend the range of equations for which we can obtain an accurate solution in reasonable time and also equations for which no closed form solution is possible. A good catalogue of differential equations is Zwillinger [​1].\n",

  "It takes a very small step size to get to an accurate solution. This is because each successive iteration continues from the result of the previous iteration, so small errors accumulate unless we proceed in very small steps (small $h$ or equivalently, large $n$). This is best seen in the plot of the solution as a function of time: the error is initially small but increases with time.\n",
