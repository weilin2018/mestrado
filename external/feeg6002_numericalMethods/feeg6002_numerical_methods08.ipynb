  "\n",
  "Along with the differential equations we have covered to date, there is another class of problems that are important in science and engineering: eigenvalue problems. They are often associated with vibrations and they also have some interesting and unique solvers which bring together a number of the technique and methods we have covered.\n",
  "\n",
  "## Eigenvalue problems and resonance problems\n",
  "\n",
  "All mechanical structures have *natural frequencies* at which they like to vibrate. Those natural frequencies depends on the distribution of mass in the structure, as well as the stiffness of the elements that make up that structure. If the structure is excited at any of these natural frequencies, it will resonate: a small excitation will produce a very large response. This response can be large enough to to lead to a break up of the structure.\n",
  "\n",
  "For example, a continuous tonal sound at the same frequency as one of the natural frequencies of a glass [can make it break](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D17tqXgvCN0E).\n",

  "It is therefore crucial to design engineering structures so that the natural resonances will not be excited. Failure to predict such resonances can lead to catastrophic collapse, as in the well known case of the [Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DXggxeuFDaDU)\n",

  "\n",
  "### Acoustics\n",
  "\n",
  "In addition to vibration problems, eigenvalue problems are ubiquitous in acoustics or optical phenomena. For example, when sound waves propagate through a pipe, they take the form of particular duct modes, corresonding to the eigenvectors of the Helmhotz equation. Similarly, sound field in a closed room fluctates according to the acoustic modes of the room. The sound quality of a concert hall therefore depends on the acoustic modes of the room.\n",

  "\n",
  "### Optics\n",
  "\n",
  "Other examples of eigenvalue problems in optics include the scattering of light by the wings of butterflies, the feathers of peacocks and the surface of opals. This produces colors that are due to structural coloring rather than pigmentation. The stunning colors they produce depend on the refraction index of these optical systems, which can be obtained by solving an eigenvalue problem.\n",

  "This method is a fairly robust way to extract all of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix. Whilst it is probably only appropriate to use for matrices up to 20 by 20, the principles of how this method operates underpin a number of more complicated methods that can be used more generally to find all of the eigenvalues of a matrix (assuming that finding such eigenvalues is actually a well-posed / stable / sensible problem).\n",
  "\n",
  "The method is based on a series of rotations, called Jacobi or [Givens rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Givens_rotation), which are chosen to eliminate off-diagonal elements while preserving the eigenvalues. Whilst successive rotations will undo previous et zeros, the off-diagonal elements get smaller until eventually we are left with a diagonal matrix. By accumulating products of the transformations as we proceed we obtain the eigenvectors of the matrix. See for example [‚Å£2, 3] for additional details.\n",

  "-   Eigenvalue problems: given a matrix $A$, find scalars $\\lambda$, called eigenvalues, and non-zero vectors $x$, called eigenvectors, such that $Ax = \\lambda x$.\n",
  "-   Give two examples of applications from the physical world involving the solution of eigenvalue problems: vibrations (bridge dynamics) and the design of concert halls (acoustic modes).\n",
  "-   Solve a simple eigenvalue problem analytically: calculate the characteristic polynomial $\\det(A - \\lambda I)$ and find the eigenvalues, then find an eigenvector for each eigenvalue by solving $(A - \\lambda I)x = 0$.\n",
  "-   Explain in your own words the Jacobi algorithm for eigenvalue problems\n",
