abstract = {This work aims to identify the synoptic scale atmospheric influence over the ocean for extreme events of storm surges events in the Southeastern Brazilian coast. Time series of sea surface height at the Port of Santos as well as wind and surface pressure from the NCEP reanalysis model enclosing the South Atlantic, for period 1951-1990, were used. Seasonal variability and typical evolution of atmospheric systems were found to be associated with extreme events, very relevant for applications on prognostics and warnings to authorities. Autumn and winter are seasons with the highest occurrence of positive extreme events (40.2 {\%} and 30.8 {\%} respectively) and the spring and winter are the ones with negative extreme events (47.2 {\%} and 32.3 {\%} respectively). The results show that the storm surges events depend on low pressure systems development and persistence over the ocean, with southwesterly winds over 8 m/s, together with a continental anticyclone presence.},
