@article{Castro1987,
abstract = {Hydrographic conditions on the continental shelf offshore of Ubatuba have shown different water mass distributions for summer (December{\~{}} 1985) and winter (July{\~{}} 1986). Two physical domains were identified: inner shelf and outer shelf{\~{}} both separated by a front particularly well defined during the winter. The inner shelf has a two layer vertical stratification during summer{\~{}} with a strong thermocline at mid-depths. During winter this region shows aZmost no stratification. During summer the upper layer (depths smaller than 20 m) is filled with Coastal Water (CW){\~{}} which interacts with Tropical Water (TW) offshore. South Atlantic Central Water (SACA) predominates in the lower layer during summer. Vertical interaction between CW and SACA is restricted to a band near the coast. During winter SACA does not penetrate towards the coast in the lower layer and{\~{}} as a consequence{\~{}} the inner shelf shows the presence of CW only. For winter interactions between CW and SACA are observed only across the front that separates inner and outer shelf. For this season there is aZso a noticeabZe intrusion of TW towards the coast on the upper layer of the ou ter shelf. A descriptive modeZ for the wind driven seasonal circuZation of the inner sheZf is sugested{\~{}} based on; 1) the water mass distributions observed and{\~{}} 2) meteoroZogicaZ conditions from a coastal station Zocated southward of Ubatuba. The outer sheZf dynamics seems to suffer strong influence from the Brazil Current. Eddies or meanders with characteristics of frontal eddies{\~{}} have been observed on both seasons on the outer shelf. These eddies should play an important role on the water mass exchange between the shelf and the slope{\~{}} contributing for the enrichment of shelf waters by the upward motion of deeper waters through its core.

@article{Cerda2014,
abstract = {A hydrographic climatology was created with the goal of establishing the mean hydrographic conditions and oceanic waters intrusion mechanisms in the central and northern parts of the South Brazil Bight on a seasonal timescale. The climatology was constructed by applying objective analysis to a historical temperature and salinity database, by season and depth, considering the anisotropy and coastal and oceanic boundary conditions. The dominance of South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) in the bottom layer, the presence of Tropical Water in the surface layer, the seasonal onshore-offshore displacement of those water masses, and the along-shore remote southward advection of SACW from Cabo Frio (23??S) are well-defined features in the analyzed and derived fields. The inshore displacement increases the volume of SACW in the shelf by approximately 780km3 from winter to spring; the offshore displacement decreases the volume of SACW by approximately 840km3 from summer to autumn. The remote advection is linked to southwestward, along-shelf transport of SACW with temperatures lower than 15??C from Cabo Frio during summer, winter, and spring. In association with the remote advection, a primary intrusion pathway of SACW is identified off Cabo Frio during those same three seasons. In spring, a secondary SACW intrusion pathway is also detected off Ubatuba (23.5??S). The existence of those two SACW intrusion pathways is promoted by the combined effect of three factors: outer shelf deepening, upwelling-favorable winds, and Brazil Current mesoscale variability. Minimum volumes of SACW and maximum volumes of Tropical Water occur in autumn, when wind activity is minimal and the minimum bottom temperature on the shelf is approximately 1??C warmer than in the other seasons (colder than 16??C).},

abstract = {Unprecedented wet conditions are reported in the 2014 summer (December–March) in South-western Amazon, with rainfall about 100{\%} above normal. Discharge in the Madeira River (the main southern Amazon tributary) has been 74{\%} higher than normal (58 000 m3 s−1) at Porto Velho and 380{\%} (25 000 m3 s−1) at Rurrenabaque, at the exit of the Andes in summer, while levels of the Rio Negro at Manaus were 29.47 m in June 2014, corresponding to the fifth highest record during the 113 years record of the Rio Negro. While previous floods in Amazonia have been related to La Ni{\~{n}}a and/or warmer than normal tropical South Atlantic, the 2014 rainfall and flood anomalies are associated with warm condition in the western Pacific-Indian Ocean and with an exceptionally warm Subtropical South Atlantic. Our results suggest that the tropical and subtropical South Atlantic SST gradient is a main driver for moisture transport from the Atlantic toward south-western Amazon, and this became exceptionally intense during summer of 2014.},

abstract = {found to be part of a large-scale teleconnection wave train linked with the subsidence branch of the Walker circula-tion in the tropical east Pacific, which in turn was generated by an anomalous tropical heat source in north/northeastern Australia. A regional Hadley circulation with an ascending branch to the south of the subsidence branch of the Walker circulation in the tropical east Pacific was identified as an important component connecting the tropical and extrat-ropical circulation. The ascending branch of this Hadley circulation in the south Pacific coincided with an identified Rossby wave source region, which contributed to establish-ing the extratropical component of the large-scale wave train connecting the south Pacific and the Atlantic region surrounding southeast Brazil. This connection between the Pacific and the Atlantic was confirmed with Rossby ray tracing analyses. The local circulation response was associ-ated to downward air motion (subsidence) over Southeast Brazil, contributing to the expressive negative precipitation anomalies observed during summer 2014, and leading to a major drought event in the historical context. The analysis of atmospheric and oceanic patterns of this event helped defining a schematic framework leading to the observed drought conditions in southeast Brazil, including the involved teleconnections, blocking high pressure, radiative and humidity transport effects.},

abstract = {The State of Sao Paulo in Brazil experienced in 2014 and early 2015 an expressive precipitation deficit, leading to drought conditions with impacts in water availability for public consumption, hydropower generation, and agriculture, particularly during austral summer. This study performs a detailed diagnostics of the observed precipitation during 2014 and early 2015 over a particular region of S{\{}{\~{a}}{\}}o Paulo State, which includes the massively populated metropolitan region of S{\{}{\~{a}}{\}}o Paulo. The diagnostic was designed to provide answers to a number of relevant questions for the activities, decisions, and strategic planning of several sectors (e.g., general public, media, and high-level governments). Examples of questions such diagnostics can help answer are: How much precipitation has the region received? Has the region experienced drought conditions in the past? When have similar drought conditions been observed in the past? What has been the observed precipitation pattern in the last years? How severe/rare were the 2014 and 2015 droughts? When does the rainy season typically start/end in the region? What happened during the 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 rainy seasons? The performed diagnostics based on historical 1961/1962--2014/2015 records revealed that the 2013/2014 austral summer was a very rare event classified as exceptionally dry. Similar drought events were previously recorded but with smaller magnitude in terms of precipitation deficits, making the 2013/2014 drought event the driest on the examined record. In fact, the region has been experiencing a precipitation deficit pattern since 1999/2000. One of the contributing factors for the expressive precipitation deficit in 2014 was the abnormally early end of the 2013/2014 rainy season in the region.},

abstract = {Since the austral summer of 2014 southeastern Brazil has been experiencing one of the most severe droughts in decades. This rainfall deficiency has generated water shortages and a water crisis that have affected population and local economies in the metropolitan region of Sao Paulo, the largest megacity in South America. By January 2015, main reservoirs had reached storage levels of only 5{\%} of their 1.3 billion m3 capacity. The meteorological causes of the drought situation were linked to changes in the regional circulation, characterized by a mid-troposphere blocking high that lasted 45 days during the summer of 2014 over southeastern Brazil, something not seen in five decades. The water crisis was aggravated by a combination of lack of rainfall and higher temperatures, the summer of 2014 being the warmest and driest over the Cantareira reservoir system since 1951. Increasing population and water consumption increased vulnerability in the region, and while human-induced warming may not have generated the atmospheric conditions behind the 2014 and 2015 summer droughts in Southeast Brazil, it is more likely that the warm temperatures have affected the severity of the drought and exacerbated the impacts on the population.},

abstract = {Altimetric data from the TOPEX/POSEIDON mission will be used for stu-dies of global ocean circulation and marine geophysics. However, it is first necessary to remove the ocean tides, which are aliased in the raw data. The tides are constrained by two distinct types of information: the hydrodynamic equations which the tidal fields of elevations and velocities must satisfy, and direct observational data from tide gauges and satellite altimetry. Here we develop and apply a generalized inverse method, which allows us to combine rationally all of this information into global tidal fields best fitting both the data and the dynamics, in a least squares sense. The resulting inverse solution is a sum of the direct solution to the astronomically forced Laplace tidal equations and a linear combination of the representers for the data functionals. The representer functions (one for each datum) are determined by the dynamical equa-tions, and by our prior estimates of the statistics of errors in these equations. Our major task is a direct numerical calculation of these representers. This task is compu-tationally intensive, but well suited to massively parallel processing. By calculating the representers we reduce the full (infinite dimensional) problem to a relatively low-dimensional problem at the outset, allowing full control over the conditioning and hence the stability of the inverse solution. With the representers calculated we can easily update our model as additional TOPEX/POSEIDON data become available. As an initial illustration we invert harmonic constants from a set of 80 open-ocean tide gauges. We then present a practical scheme for direct inversion of TOPEX/POSEIDON crossover data. We apply this method to 38 cycles of geophysi-cal data records (GDR) data, computing preliminary global estimates of the four prin-cipal tidal constituents, M 2, S2, K1, and O1. The inverse solution yields tidal fields which are simultaneously smoother, and in better agreement with altimetric and ground truth data, than previously proposed tidal models. Relative to the "default" tidal corrections provided with the TOPEX/POSEIDON GDR, the inverse solution reduces crossover difference variances significantly (=20-30{\%}), even though only a small number of free parameters (=1000) are actually fit to the crossover data.},

abstract = {A computationally efficient relocatable system for generalized inverse (GI) modeling of barotropic ocean tides is described. The GI penalty functional is minimized using a representer method, which requires repeated solution of the forward and adjoint linearized shallow water equations (SWEs). To make representer computations efficient, the SWEs are solved in the frequency domain by factoring the coefficient matrix for a finite-difference discretization of the second-order wave equation in elevation. Once this matrix is factored representers can be calculated rapidly. By retaining the first-order SWE system (defined in terms of both elevations and currents) in the definition of the discretized GI penalty functional, complete generality in the choice of dynamical error covariances is retained. This allows rational assumptions about errors in the SWE, with soft momentum balance constraints (e. g., to account for inaccurate parameterization of dissipation), but holds mass conservation constraints. While the dynamical calculations involve elevations alone, depth-averaged currents can be directly assimilated into the tidal model with this approach. The efficient representer calculation forms the basis for the Oregon State University (OSU) Tidal Inversion Software (OTIS). OTIS includes software for generating grids, prior model covariances, and boundary conditions; for time stepping the nonlinear shallow water equations to generate a first guess or prior solution; for preliminary processing of TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter data; for solution of the GI problem; and for computation of posterior error bars. Approximate GI solution methods, based on using a reduced set of representers, allow very large datasets to be inverted. OTIS regional and local GI tidal modeling (with grids containing up to 10(5) nodes) require only a few hours on a common desktop workstation. Use of OTIS is illustrated by developing a new regional-scale (1/68) model of tides in the Indonesian Seas.},
